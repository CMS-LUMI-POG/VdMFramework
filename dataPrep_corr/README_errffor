BB.py needs shared library errffor.so
beambeam_original contains binary file for lxplus
To run with it, copy it into same dir as BB.py

To make shared library yourself:
f2py --opt="-O3" -c -m errffor --fcompiler=gfortran  --link-lapack_opt *.f

This works under anaconda python, with ROOT version linked against anaconda python
